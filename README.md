# [ADFGVX/Zimmermann Telegram Encrypter/Decrypter](https://oneill.sh/apps/zimmermanntel)

This is a webpage that encrypts and decrypts texts using the same cryptographic
methods employed for the Zimmermann Telegram message that generated support for
direct US involvement in World War I.

This was one of my first programming projects. It combined my passions for
computers and history.
